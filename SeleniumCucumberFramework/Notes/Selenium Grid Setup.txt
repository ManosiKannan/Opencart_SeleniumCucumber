					-> java -jar selenium-server-4.15.0.jar standalone
			This will start a Selenium server with both the hub and node components running in a single process.
			
	3. Access Selenium Grid Console
			Open your web browser and navigate to: http://localhost:4444/
			You can see the sessions, nodes, and status of the server on this page.
			
Hub and Node Setup (Multiple Machines):
	1. Download Selenium Server
			Download selenium-server-4.15.0.jar and place it in the same directory on both the hub and node machines.
			
	2. Run Selenium Hub
			On the machine that will act as the hub, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where selenium-server-4.15.0.jar is located.
			Run the following command to start the hub:
					-> java -jar selenium-server-4.15.0.jar hub
			The hub will start and listen on port 4444 by default.

	3. Run Selenium Node
			On each machine that will act as a node, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where selenium-server-4.15.0.jar is located.
			Run the following command to start a node and register it with the hub:
					-> java -jar selenium-server-4.15.0.jar node --hub http://<hub-ip>:4444
			Replace <hub-ip> with the IP address or hostname of the machine where the hub is running.

	4. Access Selenium Grid Console
			Open your web browser and navigate to the hub machineâ€™s IP address or hostname: http://<hub-ip>:4444/
			You will see the Selenium Grid console with details about the hub and connected nodes.
